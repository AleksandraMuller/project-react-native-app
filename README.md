# Project React Native App - THE BOOKSHOP/ MY BOOKIFY APP ðŸ“±

In this project I use React Native and Styled Components to build my first mobile application. I decided to build an app in which a user can search
after books by the title. In the app user can leave a review of the chosen book, order it and even share information
about it with others.

I use the Google Books API to fetch the data. This is my first multiscreen React Native application using React Navigation.

## In this project, you will find:

- See the usage of Styled Components for styling.

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨

I used React Native / Hooks to build this project. The project is divided into multiple Components and Pages.
If I had more time, I would add style my page even more and work more on inputs.
